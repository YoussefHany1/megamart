## Project Overview

MegaMart aims to be a clean, high‑performance online storefront. Leveraging Next.js’s App Router, it organizes routes for home, category listing, product details, and cart pages. A simple JSON store provides sample data; later iterations will replace this with a real backend API.

---

## Features

- **Home page** with featured products carousel (Swiper)
- **Category pages** (`/product-page/[category]`) generated via dynamic routing
- **Product detail pages** (`/product-page/[category]/[id]`)
- **Shopping cart** with add/remove and quantity controls
- **Responsive design** optimized for mobile and desktop
- **Global styles** and component‑level CSS modules
- **Client‑side data fetching** from local `stores/data.json`
- **Loading** and **404** fallbacks

---
